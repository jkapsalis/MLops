# MLOps Project

This repository is dedicated to implementing Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) practices.
It's client class is for fetching the data from the Http API called ADZUNA API that has a variety of a data on the job market data 

## Project Structure
- **AdzunaClient/**: Interaction with the Adzuna API to fetch job market data.
- **main.py**: The main script that orchestrates data retrieval, processing, and model operations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
