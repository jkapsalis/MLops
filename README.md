# MLOps Project

This repository is dedicated to implementing Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) practices, focusing on the seamless integration and deployment of machine learning models into production environments.

## Project Structure
- **AdzunaClient/**: Contains modules for interacting with the Adzuna API to fetch job market data.
- **main.py**: The main script that orchestrates data retrieval, processing, and model operations.

## Getting Started
